    "## Stackoverflow Question Tagging Problem \n",
    "In this workshop we will use powerful language understanding model to automatically route Stackoverflow questions to the appropriate support team on the example of Azure services.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key tasks to ensuring long term success of any Azure service is actively responding to related posts in online forums such as Stackoverflow. In order to keep track of these posts, Microsoft relies on the associated tags to direct questions to the appropriate support team. While Stackoverflow has different tags for each Azure service (azure-web-app-service, azure-virtual-machine-service, etc), people often use the generic **azure** tag. This makes it hard for specific teams to track down issues related to their product and as a result, many questions get left unanswered. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to solve this problem, we will build a model to classify posts on Stackoverflow with the appropriate Azure service tag.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model which was published by researchers at Google AI Reasearch. Unlike prior language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks without substantial architecture modifications.\n",

    "Azure Machine Learning service is a cloud service that you can use to develop and deploy machine learning models. Using Azure Machine Learning service, you can track your models as you build, train, deploy, and manage them, all at the broad scale that the cloud provides.\n",
    "![](./images/aml-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can we use it for training machine learning models?\n",
    "Training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, is often a time- and compute-intensive task. Once you've finished writing your training script and running on a small subset of data on your local machine, you will likely want to scale up your workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate training, the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK provides a high-level abstraction, the estimator class, which allows users to easily train their models in the Azure ecosystem. You can create and use an Estimator object to submit any training code you want to run on remote compute, whether it's a single-node run or distributed training across a GPU cluster."
